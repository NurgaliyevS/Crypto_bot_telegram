Telegram bot that sends current prices for crypto coins and puts alerts on a specific crypto and the price you want.

This bot has its own database, the maximum simple and easy.

Different APIs are used if one of them is disabled.

This bot is my hobby so I work on it in my spare time.

Wishes and bugs are welcome.


The bot itself is located in the bot.py file.
Cryptocurrency prices are taken from the file crypto_price.py.
notification.py is used to send an alert when the user's price matches the current price.
